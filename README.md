## xarray with lazy coords

This is brand new: https://github.com/pydata/xarray/pull/9543

Here is a gist where I did my own "first-pass" at lazy coords for a world dataset: https://gist.github.com/mdsumner/dde0b611a4523e3485006c0df0143c2d

And, here is a notebook that takes a sea ice data set (polar stereographic) and builds up the lazy coords for it, from a bbox and shape.
